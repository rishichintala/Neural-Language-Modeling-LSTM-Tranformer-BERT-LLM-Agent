# Neural-Language-Modeling-LSTM-Tranformer-BERT-LLM-Agent


Tools: LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4o & GPT-3.5, Python

Designed an exam-solving agent using LangChain with custom reasoning tools to answer bigram probability questions.

Integrated OpenAI GPT-4o via API and compared behavior across Playground and ChatGPT Web.

Observed hallucinations and inconsistency in responses; documented prompt stability and tool usage accuracy.

Repurposed prior NLP tools (bigram probability, smoothing) to extend the agentâ€™s reasoning chain.
